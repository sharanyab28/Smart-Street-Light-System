# Smart-Street-Light-System
This project implements an automatic smart street lighting system designed to conserve energy and enhance safety in urban and rural areas. The system uses an LDR module to detect ambient light levels and IR sensors to detect vehicle or pedestrian movement. Based on these inputs, an Arduino Uno controls LED street lights, turning them on only when necessary.
